1 Human brain

Nothing has had a greater impact on the natural world than the human brain. It evolved from a simpler primate brain, enabling us to use rational thought to organise our lives, defend ourselves against predators and avoid danger.

It meant that we did not need to evolve physical defences such as large claws or teeth.

The human brain has millions of nerve cells, linking sensory organs to our limb and body muscles, and it processes data at high speedto instruct our bodies what to do.

The brain is also capable of abstract thought and controls speech and writing, sophisticated forms of communication that make it possible for us to change the world – and even destroy it or visit other planets. No other animal ever did that.

 

2 Arthropod exoskeleton

Arthropods (insects, spiders, crustaceans and their relatives) have become highly successful. Some are very numerous, but none is very big. Yet science-fiction films often depict giant creepy-crawlies conquering our world.

It’s impossible! Arthropods have an external skeleton and must moult it to grow, so are weak and immobilised until a larger one forms and hardens. In other words, they cannot get bigger than the maximum survivable size without a skeleton, and, as a result, the largest spiders and insects weigh less than a small rat.

 

3 Baleen plate

Whales in the suborder Mysticeti have100 or so of these tough but flexible structures hanging from their upper jaws. They scoop up massive mouthfuls of seawater, then use their tongues to forceit out through the baleen plates, trapping plankton.

Thus, the world’s largest animals have no need for the teeth so characteristic of most other mammals.

Baleen was highly valued for providing ‘springy’ support in all kinds of goods, from umbrella stays to corsets. It fetched high prices, contributing to the growth of a huge whaling industry. However, by the early 20th century (due in part to the invention of plastics) it was no longer the most valuable product of the whale harvest, but a waste product instead.

 

4 Ammonite fossil 

Ammonites were once among the most abundantof all marine creatures. They inhabited the last chamber of their coiled shells, the other chambers providing buoyancy as they drifted on the current to catch fish. Today, their fossils are found worldwide, reflecting their great success as a group of animals.

Ammonites survived for tens of millions of years, yet they all died out 65 million years ago. How could such a widespread group suddenly go extinct? Many scientists think that it was due to a meteor colliding with the Earth. Maybe we should take the ammonites’ fate more seriously: their intricate fossilised shells are a reminder that it might just happen again.

 

5 Chicken’s egg

Domestication of the Indian junglefowl has led to this species becoming the world’s most numerous, useful and abused bird. It can convertgrains and debrisinto valuable eggs and meat, but industrial chicken production has given rise to a major debate about animal welfare standards.

 

6 Root nodule

Bacteria in the nodules on the roots of clover and other ‘legumes’ take nitrogen from the air and enrich the soil. These plants have long been grown as a simple way to boost crop yields.

 

7 Scallop shell

Coastal peoples have eaten marine molluscs for millennia, but nowadays the scallop shell also stands as a reminder of how easily scallop-dredging fleets can destroy seabed ecosystems.

 

8 Yeast

Saccharomyces cerevisiae has played a vital part in human history: it reacts with starches and sugars to produce carbon dioxide and alcohol, a process harnessed to make bread and alcoholic drinks. The many other uses of yeast now extend to the manufacture of biofuels.

 

9 Pearl

Pearls form when bivalve molluscs deposit shell-lining material around an irritant ‘seed’ in their shell. Carl Linnaeus was the first to explain this process, using European freshwater mussels, and in the 1750s he proved that it couldbe stimulated artificially.

The subsequent history of pearl cultivation reveals our unrivalled ability to tinker with natural processes as we see fit.

 

10 Seabird guano

Peru’s mid-19th century golden age, the ‘Guano Era’, was built almost entirely on the profits from dealing in dung. This smelly natural resource consisted of seabird droppings harvested at coastal breeding colonies and then shipped abroad as fertiliser.

 

11 Loaf of bread

Bread made from wheat, a selectively bred member of the grass family first cultivated upto 10,000 years ago, is one of the most important human foods. To produce it, we have replaced forests and wetlands with enormous wheatfields of little useto wildlife.

 

12 Ice crystal

The unique physical properties of H2O are both creative and destructive. Water expands as it freezes, and when plant fluids freeze they burst cell walls, which is why frosts kill the majority of plants. Expansion also results in a lower density, so ice floats, enabling fish to survive the winter unscathed.

13 Mahogany

The many tropical tree species loosely referred to as ‘mahogany’ have very hard wood that resists wear and decay, making it idealfor carving and construction work. Our insatiable demand for tropical hardwoods has been a major cause of rainforest destruction.

 

14 DNA

The discovery, in the 1950s, of the double helix structureof DNA chains has enabled us to decipher inheritance mechanisms, while offering the prospect of modifying the genetic composition of living things. One day we may even create entirely new organisms.

 

15 Tree ring

Since tree rings are the physical embodiment of patterns of growth, they allow the dating of both living trees and the timber in buildings. The rings in the trunks of bristlecone pines in California reveal some of these trees to be over 5,000 years old – the oldest plants alive today.

 

16 The hole in my jumper

This natural object, or rather its absence, is the work of the clothes moth larva, one of the few animals able to digest keratin, the protein from which wool, feathers and fur are made.

 

17 Coconut

The coconut palm has one of the largest seeds in the plant kingdom. It is encased in a hard shell, surrounded by a dense, fibrous husk 2–3cm thick. These coatings protect the living tissue from damage by seawater, enabling the coconut to be dispersed by ocean currents – it is one of the few seeds to be distributed in this way.

Coconuts can be washed ashore almost anywhere, evenon British coasts, but they can germinate only on beaches within the tropics.

Historically, the coconut palm has been a major economic resource, especially on low-lying sandy islands where little else grows. It has enabled us to inhabit the remotest tropical islands. Without the coconut, our early colonisation of the tropical oceans would have been much less successful.

 

18 Foram

Foram is the shortened name for a foraminiferan, a tiny protozoan. Foraminiferans float in the marine plankton and their shells come in many shapes; for example, they may resemble tiny molluscs or bean pods.

When the animals die, their perforated shells sink to the seabed. Forams were so abundant about 100 million years ago that their remains built up in thick layers, which later became compressed to form rock. England’s chalk hills are madeof foraminiferan rock.

Forams are significant for two other reasons. Their distribution and composition give us clues about past climates, and, together with other planktonic deposits, they are a major component of oil.

 

19 On The Origin of Species

After many years gathering evidence, Charles Darwin finally published his ideas in this seminal work in 1859. He offered a powerful explanation for the diversity of life, based on natural selection encouraging progressive change among populations of variable individuals.

Though Darwin was unaware of the genetic mechanisms that make evolution possible, Origin became one of the key catalysts driving biologists’ thinking.

It might seem misleading to include Origin, a human artefact, in our list of natural objects. But, like all books, it is printed on paper, a product derived from cellulose. It thus reminds us of the important role that this plant fibre has had in shaping human thought.

 

20 Malaria mosquito proboscis

As it draws blood through its proboscis, the female Anopheles mosquito transmits the malarial parasite Plasmodium, which is one of the biggest killers of humans, responsible for widespread suffering throughout the tropics.

The parasite multiplies inside its human host, causing lethargy and periodic severe fevers. The involvement of mosquitoes in its transmission was suspected even by the ancient Greeks, but the life-cycle of Plasmodium was not unravelled until the 1940s.

Though subsequent control of Anopheles mosquitoes has been effective, there is still no cure for malaria.

 

21 Acorn 

From tiny acorns great oak trees grow, and from them magnificent warships were built. These ‘Wooden Walls of Old England’ helped to repel invading forces for centuries. English naval vessels made from oak also explored and conquered the world, helping to maintain links with the Empire until steel ships replaced them.

On land, oak timbers were the main building material for thousands of years. The wood also made excellent charcoal, fuelling the glass and metal-smelting industries.

 

22 Sugar cane

Originally a native of tropical Asia, this giant grass reaches 6m tall and is now grown in more than 100 countries. Crushing the stems yields sugars used in food flavouring and preservation and the manufacture of alcohol; the waste fibre is used to make cardboard and paper and as fuel.

Harvesting was formerly by hand – an arduous, labour-intensive task for which slaves were taken from Africa to manage the sugar plantations of the Americas.

 

23 Elephant tusk 

An elephant’s tusks are enlarged second incisors in its upper jaw, and those of the adult male African elephant are the biggest teeth of any living mammal. Like all mammalian teeth, they consist mostly of a creamy white substance called dentine.

Elephant tusk dentine – ivory – is easily carved and so has been highly prized throughout history. Before the invention of plastics, it was widely used to make relatively utilitarian objects such as knife handles, as well as ornamental items.

Trade in this ‘white gold’ went hand in hand with European exploration of the African interior, and the collapse in elephant numbers due to poaching has become one of the great environmental tragedies of recent times.

24 Leech sucker

Leeches secrete an anticoagulant through their sucker-like mouths to keep their hosts’ wounds open while they feed. They were heavily collected for medicinal use in the belief that bloodletting would cure various ailments, and are still deployed in certain specialised surgical procedures.

 

25 Mink coat

Not only does Mustela vison possess a dense layer of soft, fine underfur with exceptional insulating properties, it alsohas long, lustrous guard hairs, making the American mink the species of choice in the fashion industry. In addition to the ethical issue of wearing fur, there is also the problem of mink farm escapees, which disrupt ecosystems where they are not native.

 

26 Sigesbeckia

A ‘founding father’ of ecology and modern taxonomy, Carl Linnaeus, named this genus of insignificant, weedy plants after one of his enemies, Johann Siegesbeck. His system of binomial nomenclature remains in use today.

 

27 Stuffed bird

Millions of birds were collected and stuffed to display in Victorian and Edwardian homes. Contrary to popular belief, taxidermy may not in itself have been a threat to the populations of most bird species.

 

28 Garden peas

By propagating pea plants, Gregor Johann Mendel discovered that the inheritance of particular traits follows predictable patterns. This enabled him to formulate a set of rules that became the basis for the modern science of genetics.

 

29 Iceberg

Fragments of the polar ice caps, icebergs were once seen purely as a menace to shipping, but today they have morphed into highly visible icons of global warming.Will melting glaciers and ice caps release huge amounts of trapped water, raising sea levels far enough to obliterate low-lying countries? We simply don’t know.

 

30 Willow tree 

Wood from English willows, fashioned into cricket bats, is still handled every week by people in former British colonies. It is a symbol of the lasting impact of transferring British culture overseas to the largest empire the world has ever seen.

 

31 Banana

Originally from New Guinea, the banana is cultivated across the tropics. The fruit we eat nowadays has been bred to contain no viable seeds, so depends on human assistance for dispersal.

 

32 Tadpole shrimp 

This freshwater crustacean is a ‘living fossil’, and has changed little in at least 100 million years. The adults die when their shallow pools dry up, but their eggs remain viable for many years. The eggs have minimal respiration, challenging our perception of what life is.

 

33 Water hyacinth

Thick, choking mats of this South American plant can now be seen floating on lakes and waterways in subtropical regions around the world – a notorious example of the damage that invasive plants can wreak in new areas.

 

34 Platypus beak

When a specimen of this beaked marsupial first reached England in 1799 it was dismissed as a prank. But the platypus drew attention to the extraordinary species to be found in Australia, and posed questions about how and why they were there. The search for answers helped us to understand evolution, plate tectonics and continental drift.

 

35 Ayahuasca

This South American vine is the active ingredient in a psychedelic brew taken by Amazonian tribes during spiritual rituals. Like all hallucinogens, it warps our view of the world (apparently).

 

36 Snake hind limb 

The presence of ‘pointless’ vestigial structures such as the hind limb bones in snakes is powerful evidence of evolution.

 

37 Egg of the great auk 

The female great auk laid a single, very large egg. The advantage? A big egg produced a big chick that could go to sea soon after hatching, thereby avoiding land predators. However, this biological benefit was to seal the species’ fate.

Great auks were once widespread across the North Atlantic, but, being flightless, they were restricted to nesting on low ledges, which people found easy to reach. The auk colonies were raided for centuries by mariners and fishermen, and vast numbers of the meaty birds were taken for food and fishing bait.

Unfortunately, the great auk’s single-egg strategy could not compensate for such sustained losses, and the species became extinct when the last individual was shot on the island of Eldey, Iceland, in 1844.

 

38 Sheep incisor

It was the teeth of sheep as much as the crude tools of Neolithic man that began the deforestation of Britain. Sheep only have incisors on the lower jaw, which bite against a toothless pad above. This arrangement enables them to crop plants close to the ground, transforming the landscape with every nibble.

Flocks of sheep suppress the growth of trees and have created open habitats, such as the English South Downs, providing ideal conditions for orchids and many other species. But without a foundation of tree roots, grazed land is at risk of erosion.

 

39 Tomato

Originally a New World crop, the tomato reached Europe only in 1530, but Lycopersicon esculentum is now one of the most ubiquitous cultivated plant species. As well as being a hugely versatile food, it is a good candidate for genetic manipulation. 

One day, a GM strain of tomato may contain the genes for medicines, produced in the fruits as they grow. This could provide an inexpensive alternative to current drug production techniques, though one fraught with pitfalls, too.

40 Gastrolith

Crocodiles are renowned for their appetite for flesh, but they also swallow stones. Once these have been ingested, they become known as gastroliths.

Gastroliths have been found in the stomachs of dinosaurs, the crocodiles’ long-lost cousins, and are a prominent part of the fossil record. Theories abound as to their purpose: could they be intestinal cleaners, or act as ballast, helping bulky animals to dive underwater?

We don’t know, but the most likely role is to grind up food into a digestible paste, in much the same way that birds swallow small stones and grit to help digestion. Like birds, crocodiles can’t chew, so they bolt down chunks of flesh whole. 

But humans, like many other mammals. swing our jaws from side to side, grinding and slicing food before swallowing. Without our articulated jaws, we, too, might have to serve up stones with dinner.

 

41 Ear of wheat

Plant seeds contain a store of carbohydrate to fuel the growing shoot when it germinates, and this compact energy source is equally good at fuelling the metabolic processes of animals, including us.

Early humans gathered wild grass seeds to eat before having the idea of planting them to grow what they needed, where it was wanted.

There was a hurdle to overcome: the ears of wild grasses ‘shatter’ when ripe, spilling their seeds. So the first farmers instead selected plants that tended to hold onto their seeds. This may be a disastrous trait for a wild species, but it has ensured that the descendants of the oldest cultivated wheat plants now grow around the world.

 

42 Termite mound

In dry parts of the world, termites are the main consumers of dead plant material, fulfilling a crucial role in the ecosystem. Each colony builds a mound from soil particles cemented together with the insects’ own saliva.

A mound may be several metres high and weigh a tonne, and makes an imposing fortress for the termites. But, inside, they were at risk from overheating.

To compensate, they developed air-conditioning systems of chimneys and cooling chambers long before humansfigured out how to ventilate their own dwellings. Today, architects are even looking to their insect counterparts to find new ways of designing self-ventilating buildings.

 

43 Fossil hyena tooth 

When fossilised hyena teeth were found in Britain in the 1820s,some people saw them as evidence that Noah’s flood wiped animals from entire regions of the Earth.

Later, a more plausible explanation, involving climate change and a much older planet, was to be an important influence on Darwin during his travels.

 

44 Locust mandibles

Swarms of locusts are a force of nature that can devastate cropsin minutes. This destruction is powered by a multitude of mouths just a few millimetres wide.

 

45 Dead coral

Coral reefs are the skeletal remains of countless generations of soft, gelatinous polyps, so these tiny animals are, in a sense, ultimately responsible for thousands of wrecked shipsand lost lives. On the other hand, barrier reefs also act as nurseries for fish and protect shores from the fury of the sea.

 

46 Frog’s leg

Frog’s legs have long been key experimental tools in research into the function of muscles and their associated nerves.

 

47 Woodworm infestation

The wood-boring larva of the deathwatch beetle, otherwise known as a woodworm, naturally assists the breakdown of dead trees. In building or furniture timbers, however, its activities can be disastrous.

 

48 Fruit fly eye

Studies of the inheritance of eye colour in Drosophila fruit flies have led to major breakthroughs in our understanding of genetics.

 

49 Elephant molar

The grinding surface on elephant teeth is quite coarse, so food is not shredded finely and entire seeds can pass through their guts unscathed. Elephant dung thus contains a host of readily recognisable plant material and helps many tree species to disperse.

 

50 Honeybee pollen sac 

The hind legs of honeybees (and their relatives, such as bumblebees) have a flat, polished area surrounded by spiky hairs for carrying pollen efficiently. Called a pollen sac or corbicula, it is the insect equivalent of a shopping bag and, without it, many crops would go unpollinated.

 

51 Latex

We have harvested latex from the Hevea brasiliensis tree since prehistoric times. It can be treated by smoke to create rubber, a material that literally makes the modern world go round. In 1876, rubber tree seeds were smuggled out of Brazil to establish rival plantations in south-east Asia – an early example of biotheft.

 

52 Bird’s wing

In cross-section, a bird’s wing has curved surfaces, so that air flows faster over the top than under the bottom, creating lift. This design, known as an aerofoil, has never been bettered, and it continues to keep our aircraft in the skies.

 

53 Dromedary hoof

The broad hooves of camels enable them to walk on soft sand where horses and vehicles cannot go. These hardy (if bad-tempered) mammals made it possible for us to explore the world’s deserts.

 

54 Shark tooth

Sharks have no bones, only cartilage, but their teeth are among the hardest substances in the animal kingdom. Added to this, big species have jaw muscles that can deliver a bite force of several tonnes. Small wonder that sharks frighten and fascinate us.

55 Murex shell

This spiky-shelled marine mollusc secretes a milky substance that turns purple on contact with air, forming an intense dye worth more than its weight in silver to the ancient Greeks and Romans. Purple remains the colour of royalty and aristocracy.

 

56 Cotton

One of the most valuable natural fibres in human history, cotton has clothed us for about 8,000 years.

 

57 Cup of tea

Tea is an infusion made from the dried and powdered young leaves of Camellia sinensis. This shrub grows where annual rainfall exceeds 75cm, often at relatively high altitudes in the tropics. In a natural state, it will form small trees, but it is normally pruned to help with the harvesting of the leaves and branch tips.

Tea drinking was considered to be beneficial to health but also became a social activity, and from about 1800 it formed the basis of a major trade between India and Britain. Enormous areas here and in other parts of the British empire were given over to tea cultivation, creating a distinctive landscape largely devoid of wildlife.

 

58 Egret plume

In the late 19th century, the long, wispy feathers sported by egrets during the breeding season became highly sought-after for ornamenting fashionable ladies’ hats. 

Confusingly referred to as ‘osprey’ in the millinery trade, these plumes were imported to the auction houses of London, Paris and New York in huge quantities every season. The wholesale plunder devastated egret colonies,but contributed to a pivotal moment in the history of conservation.

In Britain, campaigns to abolish the trade, initially led by a group of women who pledged not to wear feathers, resulted in the foundation of the Society for the Protection of Birds (now the RSPB) in 1889.

 

59 Grass tussock

Unlike most plants, grasses grow from the base, allowing herbivores (and lawn mowers) to repeatedly remove their above-ground leaves without killing the plants. Grasses can thus thrive where other plants are suppressed or destroyed by grazing pressure.

These areas – grasslands – have been a major wildlife habitat since grasses first evolved, in the Miocene epoch some 20 million years ago. Meanwhile, smaller areas of grass have become one of the most versatile landscaping and sporting surfaces, a status unlikelyto be lost any time soon, despite the invention of synthetic turf.

 

60 Peacock tail feather

The ‘eyed’ feathers of male peacocks are fanned out in an extravagant display to impress females. This conspicuous courtship behaviour, which is often accompanied by cries, has stimulated endless discussion about, and research into, the nature and consequences of sexual selection in animals.

The national bird of India, the peafowl was imported to Europe as an ornamental bird and culinary novelty in the Middle Ages, and a peacock logo was adopted by US tv network NBC for its first colour transmissions in 1956.

 

61 Shipworm

A shipworm is actually a bivalve mollusc with twin shells that form ‘jaws’ that rasp their way into mangrove roots and ship timbers. Its body is shaped like a long bag, within which the wood paste is digested, and is too big to fit within the paired shells, but the animal is protected by the walls of its tunnel.

High densities of these burrows, each up to 1cm wide, are disastrous for wooden ships, whose timbers become severely weakened, resulting in leaks or even collapse. This was long a problem in tropical seas, until hulls were protected with paints and copper cladding.

 

62 Lump of coal

Coal is the compressed and fossilised remains of ancient fern-like plants that lived in the warm swamps of the Carboniferous epoch. These plants trapped the energy of the sun, which can be liberated by combustion; the ancient coal forests thus fuelled the Industrial Revolution 300 million years later.

Mining this valuable commodity had major environmental effects, burning it created pollution that killed many people each year as a result of lung disease, and the soot discoloured whole cities and encouraged industrial melanism in peppered moths. Coal is still the main source of energy for generating electricity worldwide.

 

63 Water flea

This superabundant member of the freshwater zooplankton, also known as daphnia, uses bristles on its legs to trap algae for food. It is the main natural mechanism for removing algae from rivers, lakes and drinking water. Without it, algal blooms form, and we have to filter water by artificial means.

 

64 Horseshoe crab blood

Little different from their fossils of 400 million years ago, horseshoe crabs have blue, copper-based blood that gels when it comes into contact with bacteria or toxins. The compound responsible is extracted so that medical drugs can be checked for contamination.

 

65 Cetacean ear

The heavy ear bulla (‘hearing chamber’) of cetaceans is part of a specialised auditory system that equips them with underwater echolocation and complex sounds for social communication. Our own version, sonar, is used to navigate, survey the seabed and locate fish.

 

66 Rice 

This cereal grain feeds half of the world’s human population. Its cultivation creates enormous areas of semi-aquatic habitat in tropical as well as subtropical countries.

 

67 Insect-damaged leaf

Many insects eat leaves, harming crops and garden plants. In the 1950s, chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticides were widely deployed to combat this threat, but the chemicals proved to be cumulative and harmful to entire ecosystems, and have now been withdrawn.
